## Project Name
TaskForge

## Project Idea
This platform is designed to help users organize, prioritize, and execute their tasks with intelligent suggestions and workflows. It allows real-time collaboration, tracks task progress, sends helpful reminders or nudges, and leverages basic AI/automation to help users stay productive and focused. The goal is to go beyond basic todo lists — this is about proactive support for real-life work. 

## Core Features (Initial Plan)
🗂️ Task & project creation with categories and priorities

🔄 Real-time collaboration (WebSockets)

📈 Smart reminders / nudges based on task urgency & user patterns

🔔 Notification system (push + in-app)

🧠 AI assistant (eventually) to recommend what to work on next or restructure priorities

🕓 Activity tracking or streak logging (optional)

📋 Task history & audit trail

📎 Commenting and attachments per task

## Tech Stack & Skills Focus
Backend: Java + Spring Boot (your preferred language)

Frontend: (To be decided, possibly React)

Messaging: Pulsar (already set up in your environment)

Real-time: WebSockets (with STOMP/SockJS)

Persistence: PostgreSQL

DevOps: Docker, GitHub

Security: Role-based access, JWT (planned)

This project lets you reinforce and showcase:

Microservices architecture

Event-driven design

Real-time communication

Notification handling

Scalable task management logic

## Goal for the Project
Build a real-world, portfolio-ready productivity platform

Showcase your architecture, backend engineering, and planning skills

Prepare for deeper AI/NLP integrations later

Practice building independently with guidance from senior devs when needed


## Sticking Points or Open Questions
When reaching out to a senior dev, you may want to ask:

“What core architectural patterns or models would you use to structure a scalable, intelligent task management platform with real-time collaboration, notifications, and prioritization? And what specific things should I study, prototype, or validate early to avoid mistakes later?”

Would you like me to also write a message you can send to a senior engineer or mentor — short, clear, and shows you’re serious?

What Are We Building (Vision Recap)?
TaskForge is a smart, real-time, context-aware task and project management system. It empowers users to:

Organize work using projects, tasks, categories, and statuses

Collaborate in real-time using WebSockets

Receive intelligent suggestions, reminders, and nudges

Track progress and productivity through logs and smart insights

Stay focused with personalized prioritization logic

The system isn’t a static list — it evolves with how users work.

🧠 2. Core Features We Must Cover
Domain	Features
🗂️ Task & Project	CRUD for projects, tasks, tags, categories
👥 Collaboration	Real-time task updates (WebSockets), commenting
⏰ Time & Priority	Due dates, priority levels, smart reminders
🔔 Notifications	In-app & WebSocket-based notifications
🧠 Suggestions Engine	Based on urgency, behavior, context
📊 Logs & Tracking	Activity streaks, task history, audit trails
🧾 Attachments	File support, link handling
🛠️ Admin/Settings	Role-based access, workspace config

🧑‍💼 3. Stakeholders & Users
Role	Responsibilities / Needs
End Users	Create, manage, and prioritize tasks; receive reminders
Team Leads	Assign work, monitor progress, manage timelines
System Admin	Manage users, roles, workspace settings
The Platform	Auto-suggest tasks, send nudges, track activity

🎭 4. Actors (Technical)
Actor	Description
Authenticated User	Uses UI to interact with tasks/projects
Notification Service	Sends in-app/push messages
WebSocket Server	Sends real-time updates
AI Suggestion Engine	Suggests tasks to focus on
Audit Tracker	Logs every major event
Background Scheduler	Periodically checks for overdue or high-priority tasks

🧱 5. Balanced Architecture (What You Need)
Let’s call this the "Modular-Monolith with Ports-Lite".

Why it works:

One deployable unit

Separation of concerns using packages/modules

Easier to test and scale up later

No microservice or overly verbose hexagonal layers
